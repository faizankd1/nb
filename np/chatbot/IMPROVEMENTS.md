# Local Document Chatbot: Improvements and Accuracy Guide

## What changed

- Retrieval normalizes common input typos without removing spaces from questions.
- Explicit multi-question messages are answered one question at a time.
- Chunks use bounded overlap and natural sentence/paragraph boundaries, avoiding pathological work on large files.
- CSV and Excel extraction is streamed in row blocks; document processing runs in a durable background queue.
- Images and scanned PDF pages use local Tesseract OCR. Blank or unreadable uploads report a clear no-readable-text failure instead of being indexed.
- ChromaDB semantic search is supplemented by SQLite FTS5 exact-term search. This improves retrieval of names, IDs, dates, and values.
- Every response includes source filename and source location. A configurable verifier asks the local model to reject drafts unsupported by retrieved evidence.

## Accuracy settings

Use these defaults first:

```env
TOP_K=5
RETRIEVAL_CANDIDATE_MULTIPLIER=4
HYBRID_LEXICAL_WEIGHT=0.20
LEXICAL_CANDIDATE_LIMIT=20
MIN_SIMILARITY=0.35
VERIFY_ANSWERS=true
```

Raise `TOP_K` cautiously for questions that require several sections. Lower `MIN_SIMILARITY` only after testing with real documents, because it increases the chance of weakly related evidence. Set `VERIFY_ANSWERS=false` only when faster responses are worth the reduced guardrail.

## How to measure accuracy

Create a small set of representative questions for each document, with expected facts and source locations. Include:

1. Direct factual questions.
2. Questions requiring multiple chunks.
3. Names, dates, IDs, and numbers.
4. Misspelled questions.
5. Questions with no answer in any uploaded document.
6. Multi-question messages.
7. Blank images and scanned PDFs.

For each result, record whether the answer is correct, whether its citation supports it, whether an unsupported question abstains, and the response time. Tune the settings above against those results instead of relying on subjective impressions.

## Operating boundary

This remains a single-user, local-only application. Keep both services bound to `127.0.0.1`. It does not use authentication by design.
